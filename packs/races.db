This difference may be small, but it makes a big impact in two ways. First, a vran’s body is different enough that any doctor who is not a vran and has not treated a vran successfully in the past takes a -2 penalty when using First Aid on a wounded vran and a -5 penalty when attempting to stabilize or treat Critical Wounds on a wounded vran. Second, if a vran is affected by the Frozen condition, they take a -2 to all actions until 1d6 rounds\nafter the condition is ended."}},"folder":null,"sort":0,"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.world.race.bhUFf4HJPE0T54kA"},"cf":{"id":"temp_wkfevafnmx"}},"img":"modules/MasterData/Pics/Race/Vran.jpg","effects":[]}
