The building is a spartan affair, meant as a simple sleeping quarters for young men. Should players search it for clues about the Beast, they find nothing of interest to the mystery amid a number of useful things those men have left behind, which are listed in the Sidebar The Longhouse (<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><em>loot sheet \"Longhouse loot\"</em></span>).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Henrick &amp; Hilde’s Cabin (upper)</p>\n<p>Light level: Un-modified</p>\n<p>Henrick &amp; Hilde’s cabin is small, and the party has difficulty all squeezing in for supper. But for Henrick and Hilde, it’s the only home they’ve ever had. Rustic as it is, the lodgings are tidy and well cared for. Hilde takes pride in her housework, and her father takes pride in her too. With a DC:14 Deduction or Awareness players can find Henrick’s private journal, in which he confesses to arson, theft of food, and murder of the third ice-cutting village family.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Yongar &amp; Olgar’s Cabin (lower)</p>\n<p>Light level: Un-modified</p>\n<p>Yongar &amp; Olgar live in a slightly larger cabin near the shore of Lake Tankred. The porch is the most used part of their home. Both men prefer to be outdoors, anyway. The small living area is barely used except for meals. Yongar’s room is covered in small trinkets that he collected from across the continent in his younger years, and he has an impressive collection of pressed flowers. Olgar’s room is messy. He was in the middle of repairing some ice-cutting equipment before he left for Highwatch.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Ruined Building</p>\n<p>Light level: Un-modified; Darkness in the Basement</p>\n<p>The ruined building was home to a third family that was only last year part of the ice-cutting village community, until a horrible fire swallowed them up along with their home while they slept. The players might go here to investigate, and might find out what happened on that terrible night. Nobody in the</p>\n<p>ice-cutting village likes to speak about the fire, and the remains of the family were never able to be found, nor can they bring themselves to clear the site of debris.

He wakes when the players enter the storeroom where he was napping on a stack of surplus mattresses, crumbs stuck to his face. He asks the party to let his father Yongar know that he is okay.
